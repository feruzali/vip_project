### Introduction

This project is an exploration of the capabilities of robotic automation and navigation using the TurtleBot 3 platform. Our objective was to develop a versatile robotic system capable of performing autonomous navigation, 3D mapping of its environment, obstacle avoidance, and responding to voice commands.

### Project Parts

- **3D Mapping**: Utilizing the TurtleBot 3's sensors, our robot can create a three-dimensional map of its surroundings, aiding in effective navigation and environment interaction.
- **SLAM Navigation**: Through Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), the robot can dynamically understand and map its environment while keeping track of its location.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot is equipped with intelligent sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, ensuring smooth and safe operation.
- **Voice Control**: Incorporating voice recognition, the robot can understand and execute simple voice commands, enhancing its interactivity and ease of control.
